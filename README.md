1. 🏠Property Dashboard🏠

2. Short Description / Purpose
Developed a comprehensive Property Dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze real estate sales data. The dataset contained over 650K entries across various property types. Using Excel and Power Query, I performed extensive data cleaning, transformation, and integration.

The final dashboard offers dynamic insights such as:
🔹 Total Sales & Sales by Town
🔹 Top-selling Property Types
🔹 Sales Distribution & Ratios
🔹 Interactive slicers and filters for better decision-making
This dashboard enables stakeholders to explore trends, monitor market activity, and make data-driven property investment decisions.

3. Tech Stack
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

5. Features / Highlights
🔍 Business Problem
The real estate company lacked a clear, data-driven overview of property sales trends across towns and property types. Without proper visualization and segmentation, key stakeholders were unable to identify high-performing areas, evaluate yearly performance, or understand how different residential types were performing in terms of value and volume.

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
To design an interactive, scalable Power BI dashboard that consolidates over 650K+ real estate transactions, offering decision-makers an intuitive tool to:
1. Analyze sales performance by town, year, and property type
2. Monitor key KPIs like YOY growth, average sales ratio, and total property volume
3. Filter and drill down into insights using slicers and action buttons

📊 Walkthrough of Key Visuals
1. Top 5 Towns by Sales: A bar chart ranking towns with the highest total sales volume to help focus on high-performing locations.
2. Average Sale Amount by Residential Type: A column chart comparing how various residential categories are priced on average, aiding in market segmentation.
3. Yearly Average Assessed vs. Sale Value: A dual-line chart to track the difference between estimated property value and actual sale price over time.

KPI Cards:

1. Total Properties
2. Total Towns
3. YOY Growth %
4. Average Sales Ratio
5. Resident Sales Chart: A supporting visual showing residential property performance by total sales.

Slicers: Filters for Residential Type and Year, enabling dynamic data exploration.

Interactive Buttons: Used to toggle between filter panels (e.g., town selection), improving user experience.

📈 Business Impact & Insights
1. Identified top-performing towns contributing the most to total revenue, guiding location-based marketing and investment.
2. Uncovered variations in sale amounts by residential type, supporting pricing strategy optimization.
3. YOY growth visualization helped detect positive and negative sales trends across years, supporting strategic planning.
4. Stakeholders can now quickly assess key metrics and drill down using intuitive filters, saving time and improving decision quality
